🔗 Task 5: SQL Joins – EcommerceDB

This task demonstrates all major SQL JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) using a simplified E-commerce database system.

It shows how to combine related data from multiple tables using SQL JOINs. The EcommerceDB schema was extended by adding a new Vendors table, which is linked to the existing Orders table through a foreign key.

🎯 Objective
Learn how to merge data from related tables

Use INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOINs

Understand data relationships using foreign keys

🛠 Tools Used
MySQL Workbench

🧱 Schema Extension
A new table Vendors was created and linked to the Orders table using a foreign key (vendor_id).
Sample vendor records were inserted and matched with existing orders.

🔍 JOINs Demonstrated
INNER JOIN: Show orders along with vendor information

LEFT JOIN: Show all orders, including those without a vendor

RIGHT JOIN: Show all vendors, including those without any orders (MySQL only)

FULL OUTER JOIN: Simulated using UNION (MySQL only)

✅ Outcome: Mastery of Merging Data
Gained hands-on experience with all key SQL JOIN types

Learned how to connect and retrieve data across normalized e-commerce tables
